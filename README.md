# Independent-Study
**Antonio's Senior Honors Independent Study on Neural Networks**

In my Senior Honor Independent Study course this semester, I will be studying Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), a type of artificial intelligence and machine learning process. I only just started learning to code in KMo’s APCS class last year, but I immediately became passionate about programming and wanted to study it further.

I chose to study ANNs because they are an increasingly popular topic in the field of computer science, and they combine my enthusiasm for math and computer science. In simple terms, a neural network is a layered system of nodes that imitate neurons in a biological brain. The nodes send information to each other and turn ‘on’ and ‘off’ depending on the values sent to them.

During my independent study, I want to:
* Learn how an ANN functions
* Be able to teach other computer scientists what I’ve learned
* Learn when ANNs perform tasks more effectively than a human
* Build some of my own ANNs.

To prepare for the project, I took a course on Python—a popular programming language in machine learning–over the summer. I’ll be reading books and papers on ANNs to understand how they work and how to build them during the semester.

The major assignments will be:
* Creating a small presentation to explain ANNs to a beginner
* Training a neural network to tell the difference between two or three types of objects
* Outlining a ‘learning path’ for other computer scientists to more easily learn about ANNs
* Create an ANN that can ‘imagine’ and ‘write’ numbers or letters. (stretch goal)

My first major project is finished. To use this neural network, visit https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist. Download the repo, and move the data and utils folder into the project folder for my neural network. The code used to implement the data is already included in my application file. If you want to use the MNIST dataset, download the dataset from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ and move it into the mnist folder in the data folder.

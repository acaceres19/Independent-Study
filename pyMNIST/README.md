# Python MNIST Neural Net
  This neural net, programmed in Python, is able to process both MNIST datasets: MNIST and MNIST-Fashion.
  To use this neural net, follow the instructions in the [MNIST-Fashion repository](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) to download the repository. Move the *data* and *utils* folder into the folder with my repository.
  To add the MNIST dataset, visit the [MNIST website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), download the dataset, and move the four files into the *mnist* folder within the *data* folder.
  The code to import and process the dataset is already present in the applications.

## Python MNIST Neural Network
When using this project for the first time, run FileProcessor.py.
This initializes the data to make sure the rest of the files will work.

To train neural networks and write that net information to files, run FeedforwardNeuralNet.py.

Once you have files containing net information, rename the best one (printed) to "weights.pickle"
and move it to the weight_database folder.
Then, run DigitDrawingApp.py.
This program will allow you to draw your own digits and have the trained net recognize them.
